## Why This Is a “Low-Risk” EULA

| Clause                     | Positive Practice                                           |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Clear notice of changes    | No surprise updates—user must agree to any new terms.      |
| Limited data use           | Only needed data is collected, deletion rights included.   |
| Balanced liability         | Company is liable for its mistakes, not for everything.    |
| Mutual indemnification     | Both sides protect each other.                             |
| User-friendly jurisdiction | Disputes resolved locally, not just where Company is.      |
| User IP protected          | You keep rights to your creations.                         |
| Fair termination           | Notice given, access to your data.                         |

This type of EULA demonstrates transparency, fairness, and respect for user rights—the kind your AI agent should flag as “low risk” (1–10).

## Why This Is a “Medium Risk” EULA

| Clause                    | Potential Concern/Gray Area                                   |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 14-day notice for changes | Better than none, but still allows unilateral updates.        |
| Data shared with partners | Some data is anonymized, but “product improvement and marketing” is vague. |
| Limited liability         | Caps liability to purchase price—standard, but may not cover big losses. |
| One-sided indemnification | You indemnify Company, but no mutual protection.              |
| Arbitration default       | User may lose access to courts, but exceptions for local law help. |
| Aggregate data use        | Allows some use of your data, though only in anonymized form. |
| Conditional data return   | Data may not be accessible after termination, depending on “feasibility.” |

This type of EULA isn’t automatically a dealbreaker, but you should review it carefully and clarify ambiguous points if the software is mission-critical or the data is sensitive. Your agent would flag this as “medium risk” and provide a list of questions or negotiation points.
